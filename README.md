# Sparrow


Sparrow (from Jack Sparrow the pirate) is a web app that allows users to search for movies and TV shows with torrents and watch them from a frontend web interface (TODO) by using the hls protocol.


## Features
- [x] Search movies by title (currently using the OMDB API)
- [ ] Get more information about a movie (description, rating, casting, etc)
- [x] Check if a movie is available to watch (if it has seeders and a torrent available)
- [x] Try to watch an available movie starting the torrent download, encoding it to hls and serving it to the user
- [ ] Save data to continue watching a movie later
